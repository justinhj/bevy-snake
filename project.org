* Snake tutorial notes 

https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/

bevy uses empty structs as a sort of tag

note that here we make a mutable ResMut 
this gives us a way to create assets of type ColorMaterial

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn setup(mut commands: Commands, mut materials: ResMut<Assets<ColorMaterial>>)
#+END_SRC

note that this enables fast linking (for much better iteration times)
but needs to be reverted for shipping

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[dependencies]
bevy = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["dynamic"] }
#+END_SRC

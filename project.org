* Snake tutorial notes 

https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/

bevy uses empty structs as a sort of tag

note that here we make a mutable ResMut 
this gives us a way to create assets of type ColorMaterial

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn setup(mut commands: Commands, mut materials: ResMut<Assets<ColorMaterial>>)
#+END_SRC

note that this enables fast linking (for much better iteration times)
but needs to be reverted for shipping

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[dependencies]
bevy = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["dynamic"] }
#+END_SRC

This chaining is interesting, you can connect two iterators of the same type
Here the type is entity 

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
    if reader.iter().next().is_some() {
        for ent in segments.iter().chain(food.iter()) {
            commands.entity(ent).despawn();
        }
        spawn_snake(commands, materials, segments_res)
    }
#+END_SRC

Fixing the movement bug ...

moving right
hit up
hit left 
eats self
